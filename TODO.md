- [ ] Make `get_timing` return a single int, instead of four
- [ ] Add a `on_waifu` decorator
- [ ] Make `is_wish` return Waifu or None instead of True or False
- [ ] Add optional time to way for `await_claim`

#### Would you like to see these added? Well, I'm not gonna start working until someone starts using this module :P
